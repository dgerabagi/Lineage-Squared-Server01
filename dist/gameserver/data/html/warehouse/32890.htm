Warehouse Keeper of the Ruiman:

Welcome! You probably was not easy to get here. My name is Ruiman. I am the brave Ranger Depot around Aden! Previously, he worked here, my uncle Galman, but he at this job did not work, so here I come! Can you give any items to the store and not worry about them, take a trip.
