# File to customize rtg quest rewards for each quest
# If there is a quest in the list, the calculation of awards is as bazovaoe count * RateQuestsReward * rtg of this config
# If there is no quest, the reward comes as a base count * RateQuestsReward
# Format: questId = quest.rate
# For example, to raise the reward for the quest rtg _628_HuntGoldenRam write 2 times 628 = 2.
