This is the Class Selection Menu. From here, you can Unlock new classes, select between your Unlocked classes, and can even swap your Primary class with your Secondary class!
<br><br>
It costs 250k adena. You must be inside a safe zone in order to make any class changes. Making a class change will set your mana to 0.
<br><br>
To get more Unlocks, you must obtain the Sub Class Reward item, which drops from any normal Raid Boss in the game. This item is tradable, but cannot be dropped.
<br><br>
Remember! Stacks are restricted to 1 + 1 Same Race only! No mutants! The Spoiler is the only class that can stack outside of its race. The Maestro was deleted, and all of its skills have been granted to the Spoiler. As a consequence, all players can now register recipes and Crystallize items.
<br><br>
EXP/Skill Limitations<br>
Your Secondary Class must be within 15 levels in order to gain XP. In between 9 and 15, your Secondary will only gain 30% EXP, and if within 9 levels, your Secondary will gain EXP at the regular rate.
<br><br>
You will NOT gain any skills from your Secondary if those skills are normally gained at a higher level than the current level of your Primary. For example, a level 35 Primary wont have level 85 skills even if his Secondary is level 85.
<br><br>
Moreover, you will not acquire any over enchanted skills from a high level Secondary on any Primary under level 76. This means no +30 Hurricane at level 40, sorry.
