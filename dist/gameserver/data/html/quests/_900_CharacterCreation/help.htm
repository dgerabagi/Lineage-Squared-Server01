<title>Character Creation Process - Help</title>

<body>

<center>

Welcome to Lineage²!<br><br>
Simply put, every character will have the ability to "Unlock" every Class in the game. (Press Alt + B, then choose Favorite)<br>
Players will only be allowed to combine Same-Race Classes. No Mutants allowed! Sorry Hawkeye/Tyrant lovers, but this server isn't for you!<br>
To get started, simply make your first class combination at this NPC.<br>
To Unlock more Classes, you can obtain a "Sub Class Reward" item from any Raid Boss in the game!<br>
Thats all for now! Good luck, and happy Stacking! ^.^
