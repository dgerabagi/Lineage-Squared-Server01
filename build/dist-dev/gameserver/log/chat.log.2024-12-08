[08.12.24 21:43:39] TELL [PacMan -> Jarvan] can you send me a screenshot of what u see on the vote page? yea lets go mess with QA
[08.12.24 21:44:05] TELL [Jarvan -> PacMan] So about that vote here is the issue
[08.12.24 21:44:44] TELL [Jarvan -> PacMan] I log into ACP, select my char. Then i go vote ofc and when i have voted on all sites i only....
[08.12.24 21:45:33] TELL [Jarvan -> PacMan] ...only vote on the 5 sites from ACP. Then when i exchange reward...
[08.12.24 21:45:55] TELL [Jarvan -> PacMan] my char was offline because it requires to be offline, so i exchanged and got nothing in return
[08.12.24 21:46:06] TELL [Jarvan -> PacMan] no leafs and no recs
[08.12.24 21:46:13] TELL [PacMan -> Jarvan] ah ok
[08.12.24 21:46:25] TELL [Jarvan -> PacMan] that was like yestarday
[08.12.24 21:46:36] TELL [Jarvan -> PacMan] now i can try to vote and do the same
[08.12.24 21:46:40] TELL [PacMan -> Jarvan] nah its ok
[08.12.24 21:46:47] TELL [PacMan -> Jarvan] the exchange votes needs to be upgraded
[08.12.24 21:46:53] TELL [PacMan -> Jarvan] in the same way that i upgraded the vote itself
[08.12.24 21:47:01] TELL [PacMan -> Jarvan]  i dont want you to have to log out
[08.12.24 21:47:31] TELL [PacMan -> Jarvan] i havent revisited the exchange votes since i created it, so i have probably broken it in workin 
[08.12.24 21:47:38] TELL [PacMan -> Jarvan] on other things, ill circle back on that perhaps tomorrow
[08.12.24 21:47:50] TELL [Jarvan -> PacMan] yy
[08.12.24 21:47:55] TELL [Jarvan -> PacMan] that might be it
[08.12.24 21:49:56] TELL [Jarvan -> PacMan] port me to AQ please
[08.12.24 21:51:21] PARTY [PacMan] what lvl r u
[08.12.24 21:51:24] PARTY [Jarvan] low
[08.12.24 21:51:31] PARTY [PacMan] ok, im 44, and i disabled exp gain
[08.12.24 21:51:33] PARTY [Jarvan] thats how i discoverd it
[08.12.24 21:51:35] PARTY [PacMan] im summoning u
[08.12.24 21:51:39] PARTY [Jarvan] y
[08.12.24 21:52:12] PARTY [Jarvan] these are no problem
[08.12.24 21:52:27] PARTY [Jarvan] but once i start hitting AQ
[08.12.24 21:52:33] PARTY [Jarvan] they heal so much and insta spawn
[08.12.24 21:53:25] PARTY [Jarvan] cant do it
[08.12.24 21:54:29] PARTY [Jarvan] maybe they run ot of mana?
[08.12.24 21:54:38] PARTY [Jarvan] if we keep hitting AQ?
[08.12.24 21:54:48] PARTY [PacMan] nah, the only think im thinking is a sorc
[08.12.24 21:55:07] PARTY [Jarvan] im thinking its not a 2 man job what it is
[08.12.24 21:55:07] PARTY [PacMan] also let me see i think i found their respawnt imer
[08.12.24 21:55:52] PARTY [PacMan] nah its doable with small numbers with the right motivation haha, im just thinking and looking at the co
[08.12.24 21:55:54] PARTY [PacMan] code rn
[08.12.24 21:56:00] PARTY [Jarvan] hehe
[08.12.24 21:56:05] PARTY [Jarvan] yy take your time
[08.12.24 21:57:01] PARTY [PacMan] okay the nurses are on a 10 second timer
[08.12.24 21:57:17] PARTY [PacMan] do they spawn always next to queena nt?
[08.12.24 21:57:22] PARTY [Jarvan] yy
[08.12.24 21:57:53] PARTY [Jarvan] and i could not make them give up unless AQ gave up too
[08.12.24 21:58:39] PARTY [Jarvan] tried with pole too
[08.12.24 21:59:35] PARTY [PacMan] heh
[08.12.24 21:59:38] PARTY [Jarvan] I was wondering 
[08.12.24 21:59:49] PARTY [Jarvan] How does an olympiad works on this server?
[08.12.24 22:00:01] PARTY [PacMan] its team based
[08.12.24 22:00:04] PARTY [Jarvan] since there are no main class
[08.12.24 22:00:08] PARTY [Jarvan] how so
[08.12.24 22:00:18] PARTY [PacMan] 2v2, 4v4, 6v6 i believe is what i did
[08.12.24 22:00:31] PARTY [PacMan] top teams get hero
[08.12.24 22:00:41] PARTY [Jarvan] very interesting
[08.12.24 22:01:30] PARTY [Jarvan] wpn +?
[08.12.24 22:01:46] PARTY [PacMan] 40, gonna increase more
[08.12.24 22:01:50] PARTY [Jarvan] hahaha
[08.12.24 22:01:52] PARTY [Jarvan] try 100
[08.12.24 22:02:54] PARTY [Jarvan] dont kill the ants that heal, lets see how much dmg do you need to outheal them
[08.12.24 22:03:55] PARTY [Jarvan] thats crazy
[08.12.24 22:04:06] PARTY [PacMan] almost had it
[08.12.24 22:04:19] PARTY [Jarvan] Not fair
[08.12.24 22:04:21] ALL [Jarvan] xC
[08.12.24 22:04:22] ALL [Jarvan] xD
[08.12.24 22:04:51] ALL [PacMan]  +1000
[08.12.24 22:04:56] PARTY [Jarvan] yeah
[08.12.24 22:05:02] PARTY [Jarvan] wont be a 10 man job either
[08.12.24 22:05:29] PARTY [PacMan] all u gotta do have enough burst to kill a nurse before it heals
[08.12.24 22:05:36] PARTY [PacMan] then u do ur rotation
[08.12.24 22:05:41] PARTY [Jarvan] yeah but they insta heal
[08.12.24 22:05:48] PARTY [PacMan] they dont, they have a casting time
[08.12.24 22:05:51] PARTY [Jarvan] cast time too high 
[08.12.24 22:06:01] PARTY [PacMan] a couple sorcs im tellin u
[08.12.24 22:06:03] PARTY [Jarvan] that would be a challange
[08.12.24 22:06:15] PARTY [PacMan] bugs are fire weak
[08.12.24 22:06:29] PARTY [Jarvan] make sense
[08.12.24 22:06:40] PARTY [PacMan] next time we can try with a sorc
[08.12.24 22:06:44] PARTY [PacMan] i wont need nearly as much matk
[08.12.24 22:06:54] PARTY [PacMan] so ill bring like 3 char equivalent of matk if that makes sense
[08.12.24 22:06:57] PARTY [PacMan] vs this crazy patk
[08.12.24 22:07:01] PARTY [Jarvan] yeah
[08.12.24 22:07:05] PARTY [Jarvan] would make more sense
[08.12.24 22:07:19] PARTY [Jarvan] would not lv my sorc for that experiment
[08.12.24 22:07:28] PARTY [PacMan] yea, or u can have another mage as a low lvl
[08.12.24 22:07:30] ALL [Jarvan] keeping it low lvl :P
[08.12.24 22:07:33] PARTY [PacMan] and have ur sorc as secondary
[08.12.24 22:07:47] PARTY [Jarvan] that works too
[08.12.24 22:08:00] PARTY [Jarvan] i also had question about kamael classes
[08.12.24 22:08:01] PARTY [PacMan] i actually gotta experiment cause i have zealot rn, what lvl do u get that isnt it higher lvl
[08.12.24 22:08:16] PARTY [Jarvan] its like 63
[08.12.24 22:08:18] PARTY [Jarvan] or 66
[08.12.24 22:08:32] PARTY [Jarvan] those kamael classes are wack
[08.12.24 22:08:41] PARTY [Jarvan] very weak in terms of other combos
[08.12.24 22:08:53] PARTY [PacMan] not a lot i can do about it... other than start editing their skills
[08.12.24 22:09:00] PARTY [Jarvan] nah
[08.12.24 22:09:01] PARTY [PacMan] kamaels are treated very differently by the game engine
[08.12.24 22:09:19] PARTY [PacMan] when u switch kamael it changes all armor skins too
[08.12.24 22:09:22] PARTY [PacMan] u have to relog ur char
[08.12.24 22:09:35] PARTY [Jarvan] i was thinking that u set their classes with something predefined 
[08.12.24 22:09:41] PARTY [Jarvan] just like now but different combos
[08.12.24 22:09:47] PARTY [PacMan] that is what i do
[08.12.24 22:09:49] PARTY [Jarvan] just to balance them a bit
[08.12.24 22:09:58] PARTY [PacMan] since theres only one combination that makes sense the melee/melle range/range
[08.12.24 22:10:04] PARTY [PacMan] male/male female/female
[08.12.24 22:10:25] PARTY [Jarvan] i was thinking cross race 
[08.12.24 22:10:28] PARTY [PacMan] beyond editing the skills themselves
[08.12.24 22:10:33] PARTY [Jarvan] but that would break the servr rules i believe
[08.12.24 22:11:02] PARTY [Jarvan] or maybe trickster/doombranger 
[08.12.24 22:11:30] PARTY [PacMan] trickster is archer and doombringer is close range, no?
[08.12.24 22:11:36] PARTY [Jarvan] yeah
[08.12.24 22:11:43] PARTY [PacMan] hows that gonna combine?
[08.12.24 22:12:19] PARTY [PacMan] short of just straight boosting kamaels... like +30% dmg buff
[08.12.24 22:12:31] PARTY [Jarvan] so the doombranger have a couple useful skills that counter close combat attacks
[08.12.24 22:12:47] PARTY [Jarvan] and a good passive too
[08.12.24 22:12:58] PARTY [PacMan] which skills? does it require switching weapons to use them? its not a good combinatoin
[08.12.24 22:13:08] PARTY [Jarvan] might work its charm or trickster agains pvp but thats about it 
[08.12.24 22:13:36] PARTY [Jarvan] no like true berserker is toggle buff, eye for eye i think was the name
[08.12.24 22:13:44] PARTY [Jarvan] or something like that
[08.12.24 22:13:55] PARTY [Jarvan] violent temper debuff that reduce p.def
[08.12.24 22:14:00] PARTY [PacMan] hmmmmmm
[08.12.24 22:14:55] PARTY [Jarvan] is it possible to combine trickster and doombringer without you modifying anything 
[08.12.24 22:14:59] PARTY [Jarvan] just to see what will come out of it
[08.12.24 22:15:25] PARTY [Jarvan] i mean adding it like a sub class option
[08.12.24 22:15:28] PARTY [PacMan] not quickly, and once u restart its gone
[08.12.24 22:15:37] PARTY [PacMan] individually add each skill by id
[08.12.24 22:15:49] PARTY [Jarvan] wont be worth 
[08.12.24 22:16:23] PARTY [Jarvan] in the website i see that you have the blessed jewels
[08.12.24 22:16:31] PARTY [Jarvan] and all other raid jewels as wellk
[08.12.24 22:16:33] PARTY [Jarvan] well*}
[08.12.24 22:16:41] PARTY [PacMan] ye just finished that up today, what do u think?
[08.12.24 22:16:48] PARTY [Jarvan] beautiful work 
[08.12.24 22:16:51] PARTY [PacMan] i also show who owns them, so u can see them transition hands

[08.12.24 22:17:27] PARTY [PacMan] its got a bill gates covid chip
[08.12.24 22:17:45] PARTY [Jarvan] hahahaha]
[08.12.24 22:18:07] PARTY [Jarvan] jesus it actually says where it is
[08.12.24 22:18:26] PARTY [Jarvan] thats some crazy stuff
[08.12.24 22:18:43] PARTY [PacMan] i just told AI what i wanted to see
[08.12.24 22:18:54] PARTY [PacMan] helped me write the code
[08.12.24 22:18:57] PARTY [Jarvan] making l2 with AI
[08.12.24 22:18:59] PARTY [Jarvan] that is sick
[08.12.24 22:19:12] PARTY [Jarvan] have u checked all other epic raids
[08.12.24 22:19:20] PARTY [Jarvan] their drops
[08.12.24 22:19:27] PARTY [Jarvan] retail everything?
[08.12.24 22:19:30] PARTY [PacMan] yeah these are my old files, and they all function, i had major clans running the raids, etc
[08.12.24 22:19:51] PARTY [Jarvan] damn
[08.12.24 22:19:56] PARTY [PacMan] right now i have two servers running actually
[08.12.24 22:20:03] PARTY [PacMan] i just got a modern l2j version of high five
[08.12.24 22:20:10] PARTY [PacMan] im starting to remake my stackclass there
[08.12.24 22:20:18] PARTY [Jarvan] what the difference
[08.12.24 22:20:18] PARTY [PacMan] cause my files are literally 10 yrs old, no more updates coming
[08.12.24 22:20:45] PARTY [PacMan] well they're really good files
[08.12.24 22:20:49] PARTY [PacMan] so not too much
[08.12.24 22:21:05] PARTY [Jarvan] have funn
[08.12.24 22:21:41] PARTY [PacMan] the problem is like if for example, i wanted to incorporate autofarm
[08.12.24 22:21:51] PARTY [PacMan] i cant use the l2j autofarm pack
[08.12.24 22:21:55] PARTY [PacMan] i have a different server pack
[08.12.24 22:22:03] PARTY [PacMan] id have to create my own custom version of autofarm...
[08.12.24 22:22:14] PARTY [Jarvan] too much hasle
[08.12.24 22:22:21] PARTY [Jarvan] i think now everyone has bots
[08.12.24 22:22:31] PARTY [Jarvan] tower, walker, adrena 
[08.12.24 22:22:37] PARTY [Jarvan] all so accessible
[08.12.24 22:22:43] PARTY [PacMan] yea, well thast why i like the autofarm idea tbh
[08.12.24 22:22:46] PARTY [Jarvan] and better then any autofarm out there
[08.12.24 22:22:47] PARTY [PacMan] give everyone the ability
[08.12.24 22:22:56] PARTY [PacMan] actually u know what
[08.12.24 22:22:58] PARTY [Jarvan] thats true
[08.12.24 22:23:01] PARTY [PacMan] i could probably make a fking epic autofarm
[08.12.24 22:23:09] PARTY [PacMan] use the existing one as a blueprint of how to build one
[08.12.24 22:23:14] PARTY [Jarvan] u could haha
[08.12.24 22:23:16] PARTY [PacMan] cause i was a botting expert back in the day lol
[08.12.24 22:23:21] PARTY [PacMan] just like my autopotion
[08.12.24 22:23:26] PARTY [PacMan] is a fuck you to the macro ppl
[08.12.24 22:23:31] PARTY [PacMan] autofarm is a fuck you to the botters
[08.12.24 22:23:42] PARTY [Jarvan] well...
[08.12.24 22:23:47] PARTY [Jarvan] that autopotion stuff
[08.12.24 22:23:55] PARTY [Jarvan] kind a not working very good
[08.12.24 22:23:59] PARTY [PacMan] why?
