[07.12.24 00:42:45] ALL [MecanOtGorata] it was my problem
[07.12.24 00:42:51] ALL [MecanOtGorata] because it was quest item
[07.12.24 00:43:17] ALL [MecanOtGorata] Im having trouble 
[07.12.24 00:43:20] ALL [MecanOtGorata] with this NPC
[07.12.24 00:43:33] ALL [MecanOtGorata] when i try to talk to him, he is not opening his window
[07.12.24 00:43:40] ALL [PacMan] its in the validation period

[07.12.24 00:44:33] ALL [MecanOtGorata] yeah
[07.12.24 00:44:36] ALL [PacMan] ye
[07.12.24 00:44:40] ALL [MecanOtGorata] its my mistake then
[07.12.24 00:44:42] ALL [PacMan] i checked the code
[07.12.24 00:44:48] ALL [MecanOtGorata] i was able to talk to him
[07.12.24 00:44:51] ALL [MecanOtGorata] open window
[07.12.24 00:44:52] ALL [PacMan] the reason i can see it is cause it says also if ur admin
[07.12.24 00:45:08] ALL [MecanOtGorata] but its on my other chart which is registered
[07.12.24 00:45:25] ALL [PacMan] ye, i forget all the little intricacies of this game lol
[07.12.24 00:45:29] ALL [MecanOtGorata] how much is safe enchant here? im not able to find any info
[07.12.24 00:45:31] ALL [PacMan] i just had to fix the subclass quest
[07.12.24 00:45:45] ALL [PacMan] ill add that to the features list, its retail-like
[07.12.24 00:45:54] ALL [MecanOtGorata] yeah that was my idea
[07.12.24 00:46:08] ALL [MecanOtGorata] to add like list of the server Features
[07.12.24 00:46:16] ALL [MecanOtGorata] it would be useful
[07.12.24 00:46:25] ALL [MecanOtGorata] getting info checked out
[07.12.24 00:46:26] ALL [PacMan] ye adding now :)
[07.12.24 00:46:43] ALL [MecanOtGorata] so sub class should work now?
[07.12.24 00:47:05] ALL [Andromache] what about the skill certifications ?
[07.12.24 00:47:10] ALL [Andromache] how do we obtain those
[07.12.24 00:47:31] ALL [PacMan] here, its the fates whisper quest
[07.12.24 00:47:39] ALL [PacMan] then u can choose which ones
[07.12.24 00:47:48] ALL [MecanOtGorata] Yeah, i completed the Fate Quest
[07.12.24 00:47:53] ALL [PacMan] beta shop has fates whisper quest items
[07.12.24 00:47:55] ALL [MecanOtGorata] but now it requires another quest xD
[07.12.24 00:48:15] ALL [PacMan] just the item at that point
[07.12.24 00:48:15] ALL [MecanOtGorata] Mimir's Elixir quest 
[07.12.24 00:48:29] ALL [PacMan] no im pretty sure u dont need mimirs elixir
[07.12.24 00:48:37] ALL [PacMan] for skill certs 
[07.12.24 00:48:41] ALL [MecanOtGorata] no certs
[07.12.24 00:48:46] ALL [MecanOtGorata] im talking about sub class
[07.12.24 00:48:47] ALL [PacMan] i only completed mimirs today to test noble
[07.12.24 00:48:49] ALL [PacMan] ah yes
[07.12.24 00:48:54] ALL [PacMan] i did this today to fix it
[07.12.24 00:48:54] ALL [MecanOtGorata] I have completed the sub class quest 
[07.12.24 00:49:07] ALL [PacMan] u can take kamael sub class now
[07.12.24 00:49:10] ALL [MecanOtGorata] but now it wants me to complete the Mimir's Elixir Quest also
[07.12.24 00:49:30] ALL [PacMan] yes thats part of subclass
[07.12.24 00:50:02] ALL [MecanOtGorata] will do it later at some point im guessing
[07.12.24 00:50:02] ALL [PacMan] i added some items from the q 
[07.12.24 00:50:09] ALL [PacMan] let me refresh multi sell
[07.12.24 00:50:18] ALL [MecanOtGorata] sure
[07.12.24 00:51:09] ALL [PacMan] oh actually thats right, i couldnt just spawn the items for mimirs, it wouldnt progress the quest proper
[07.12.24 00:51:16] ALL [PacMan] properly, i had to just go to the locations
[07.12.24 00:51:31] ALL [MecanOtGorata] im guessing yeah
