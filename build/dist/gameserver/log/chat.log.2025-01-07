[07.01.25 09:08:27] TELL [Mochin -> Omoi] with pole? how is it going?
[07.01.25 09:09:15] TELL [Omoi -> Mochin] with just this one group fine. but if i go to room with 3 i sometimes die
[07.01.25 09:09:37] TELL [Omoi -> Mochin] need to do that zaken XD
[07.01.25 09:09:44] TELL [Mochin -> Omoi] ye
[07.01.25 10:09:17] TRADE [NightWitch] sup
[07.01.25 10:12:21] TELL [Omoi -> NightWitch] rune
[07.01.25 10:13:19] TELL [NightWitch -> Omoi] omw
[07.01.25 10:13:55] CLAN [Omoi] why you have 2 chars :D
[07.01.25 10:13:57] CLAN [NightWitch] ty oh! leader
[07.01.25 10:14:11] CLAN [NightWitch] I have 4 (technically)
[07.01.25 10:14:21] CLAN [NightWitch] desiding what to play
[07.01.25 10:14:45] CLAN [Omoi] see what class i am?
[07.01.25 10:14:55] CLAN [NightWitch] gk
[07.01.25 10:15:04] CLAN [Omoi] and now?
[07.01.25 10:15:12] CLAN [NightWitch] hm
[07.01.25 10:15:19] CLAN [NightWitch] I thought it was same race only
[07.01.25 10:15:29] CLAN [Omoi] for the stack yes
[07.01.25 10:15:40] CLAN [Omoi] so i can only do ghost hunter sk
[07.01.25 10:15:42] CLAN [Omoi] not sk titan
[07.01.25 10:15:50] CLAN [NightWitch] ah so I can be GK but if I want gk with titan skills I need new char
[07.01.25 10:16:25] CLAN [Omoi] no
[07.01.25 10:16:32] CLAN [Omoi] you can have gk with titan skills
[07.01.25 10:16:42] CLAN [Omoi] but not with a class from a other race
[07.01.25 10:16:47] CLAN [Omoi] doesnt matter what race your char is
[07.01.25 10:16:51] CLAN [Omoi] its about the race of the class
[07.01.25 10:16:55] CLAN [NightWitch] oooohhhh
[07.01.25 10:17:00] CLAN [NightWitch] this is so confusing XD
[07.01.25 10:17:26] CLAN [Omoi] and to unlock more classes you either kill rbs or buy item from gm shop
[07.01.25 10:17:35] CLAN [Omoi] i have almost all classes unlocked
[07.01.25 10:18:17] CLAN [NightWitch] so it really doesn't matter what you make and choose in the begining
[07.01.25 10:18:23] CLAN [Omoi] correct
[07.01.25 10:18:45] CLAN [NightWitch] well, the choiice in main class is bs then cause mage lvls up like shiet XD
[07.01.25 10:19:15] CLAN [NightWitch] can I have some p-lvl sir? :3
[07.01.25 10:19:48] CLAN [Omoi] only from 70 i think
[07.01.25 10:20:06] CLAN [Omoi] and there is also some limit in power leveling your second class
[07.01.25 10:20:23] CLAN [Omoi] so you can be 85 with main and just kill soa with lvl 1 sub
[07.01.25 10:20:30] CLAN [Omoi] cant*
[07.01.25 10:20:36] CLAN [Omoi] who is ichigo btw
[07.01.25 10:20:46] CLAN [NightWitch] doesn't matter anymore :3
[07.01.25 10:20:52] CLAN [Omoi] XD
[07.01.25 10:21:25] CLAN [NightWitch] you gonna farm? I am 72
[07.01.25 10:21:35] CLAN [Omoi] sure i can make you 85 fast
[07.01.25 10:21:56] CLAN [NightWitch] I would appreciate that
[07.01.25 10:23:02] CLAN [NightWitch] aw <3
[07.01.25 10:23:09] PARTY [Omoi] 84 soa
[07.01.25 10:23:19] PARTY [NightWitch] what you wearing?
[07.01.25 10:24:01] PARTY [Omoi] dynasty
[07.01.25 10:27:14] PARTY [NightWitch] how about the spoiler. what skills does he get?
[07.01.25 10:27:59] PARTY [Omoi] spoil and sweep :3
[07.01.25 10:28:12] PARTY [NightWitch] so you don't get 2ndary skills from anyone 
[07.01.25 10:28:23] PARTY [Omoi] you can combine spoiler with any class
[07.01.25 10:28:27] PARTY [Omoi] its exception
[07.01.25 10:28:41] PARTY [NightWitch] aha
[07.01.25 10:28:46] PARTY [NightWitch] good good
[07.01.25 10:28:49] PARTY [NightWitch] Imma make spoilers
[07.01.25 10:29:21] PARTY [NightWitch] different lvls for different spots
[07.01.25 10:29:44] PARTY [Omoi] domi has passive that gives mp back for each hit
[07.01.25 10:29:52] PARTY [Omoi] and the patk/pdef toggles
[07.01.25 10:29:54] PARTY [Omoi] pretty good
[07.01.25 10:31:11] PARTY [Omoi] but if you get herbs and dont need pdef then gk gives 100crit, 30cd and a lot atk spd
[07.01.25 10:31:22] PARTY [Omoi] the totems work with any weapon
[07.01.25 10:31:25] PARTY [Omoi] kinda broken
[07.01.25 10:31:30] PARTY [NightWitch] Yeah was thinking GK was the best choice
[07.01.25 10:32:05] PARTY [Omoi] gk/spoiler with dual dagger is pretty sttrong
